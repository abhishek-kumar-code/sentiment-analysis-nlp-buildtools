# Evaluate A News Article with Natural Language Processing

<img src="images/nlp.jpeg" width="1000">

## About the Project
The goal of this project is to build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.

The motive of this project is to have a taste of the environment and tools you will most likely come across in a front end role. 

## Introduction to Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subset of AI that provides computers ability to process or interact with natural human speech. In NLP, machine learning and deep learning are used on massive amounts of data to obtain the rules and understanding of nuance in human speech. NLP is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

## Webpack

At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. Webpack takes all the assets and “bundles” or combines them into fewer files that are much easier to manage. Notice that multiple .js files on the left became one .js file on the right - that’s because the two files were combined into one large .js file.

## MeaningCloud API

We will make use of an external API called MeaningCloud to interact with their NLP system. This tool will help us classify the information available in the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone. MeaningCloud has put a public-facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in our project to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.

## Project Requirements

* Webserver - Node
* Web application framework for routing - Express
* Build tool - Webpack. Using webpack, we will set up the app to have dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.
* External script - Service Worker
* External API - MeaningCloud

	i. Install the dotenv package
	```
	npm install dotenv
	```
	ii. Create a new `.env` file in the root of your project
	iii. Fill the `.env` file with your API key like this:
	```
	API_KEY=**************************
	```
4. Start the project
